# Consensus_based-Rendezvous
As part of the Systems and Process Control course, this project focuses on the implementation of a consensus-based rendezvous algorithm. The main objective of the project is to solve the rendezvous problem between multiple agents using distributed consensus control techniques. The rendezvous problem involves multiple agents starting from different positions and converging to a common position without centralised control, respecting system constraints and using limited communication between agents. 
The uploaded Matlab code demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in various scenarios, simulating the behaviour of multiple agents in dynamic environments. The project includes simulations that highlight the robustness and scalability of the algorithm, showing its potential applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, robotics and distributed systems. If you have any further queries, clarifications or discussions on this project, I will be happy to provide you with further information or send you the presentation made on the project.
